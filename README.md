# Actin.Morpheus.model
This is a model of actin remodelling in a dendritic spine. The software used is Morpheus.
There are two types of codes (xml files). The first one is based on a CPM model and depicts each actin unit as a cell interacting in a 2D space.
The second is based on Conway"s Game of Life and it is simulated in a hexagonal grid.
Finally there is the biochemical pathway which describes the interactions between biomolecules in the dendritic spine. These interactions are presented in the form of ODEs.
